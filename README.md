## Sum of Digits of a Number

The sum of the digits of a number is calculated by adding all individual digits together. This operation is often useful in various numerical analysis and algorithmic tasks.

#### Example
Input: 1234
Output: 10
Here, the sum of digits is calculated as 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

## Reverse of a Number

Reversing a number involves reversing the order of its digits. This is commonly used in number manipulation problems and checking for palindromes.

#### Example
Input: 1234
Output: 4321
In this example, the digits are rearranged from 1234 to 4321.

## Palindrome Number

A palindrome number reads the same backward as forward. This concept is used in problems related to symmetry and pattern recognition.

#### Example
Input: 121
Output: True
The number 121 is a palindrome because it reads the same backward and forward.

## Armstrong Number

An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. This property is often explored in number theory.

#### Example
Input: 153
Output: True
The number 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.

## Divisors of a Number

The divisors of a number are all the numbers that divide it exactly, leaving no remainder. This is a fundamental concept in number theory and is used to find factors, greatest common divisors, and more.

#### Example
Input: 6
Output: [1, 2, 3, 6]
The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

## Check Prime Number

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Identifying prime numbers is essential in fields like cryptography.

#### Example
Input: 7
Output: True
The number 7 is a prime number because it cannot be divided by any number other than 1 and 7.

## Find GCD

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. This concept is crucial in simplifying fractions and number theory.

#### Example
Input: (8, 12)
Output: 4
The GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
